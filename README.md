Here are the steps to my code:
### `server.py`

1. **Import necessary modules:**
   - `socket`: Provides low-level networking interface.

2. **Server Configuration:**
   - `HOST` and `PORT` are defined to set up the server on the specified IP address and port.

3. **Socket Creation and Binding:**
   - `socket.socket()` is used to create a socket.
   - `bind()` associates the socket with a specific network interface and port.

4. **Listening for Connections:**
   - `listen()` enables the server to accept incoming connections.

5. **Client List and Message Broadcasting Functions:**
   - `clients` is a list to store connected client sockets.
   - `broadcast(message, client_socket)` sends a message to all connected clients except the sender.

6. **Handling Individual Clients:**
   - `handle_client(client_socket)` is a function run in a separate thread for each client.
   - It continuously receives messages from a client and broadcasts them to others.

7. **Accepting Connections:**
   - `accept_connections()` runs in the main thread, accepting new connections and starting a thread for each.

8. **Server Startup:**
   - The server is started by binding to the specified IP and port, then continuously accepting and handling connections.

### `client.py`

1. **Import necessary modules:**
   - `socket`: Provides low-level networking interface.
   - `threading`: Used to handle multiple tasks concurrently.
   - `tkinter`: GUI library for creating the client interface.

2. **Client Configuration:**
   - `HOST` and `PORT` are defined to connect to the server on the specified IP address and port.

3. **Socket Creation and Connection:**
   - `socket.socket()` is used to create a socket.
   - `connect()` connects the client to the server.

4. **Tkinter GUI Setup:**
   - `tkinter` is used to create a simple GUI with a text display area, message input field, and send button.

5. **Message Sending Function:**
   - `send_message()` retrieves the message from the entry field, sends it to the server, and clears the entry field.

6. **Receiving Messages from the Server:**
   - The `receive()` function runs in a separate thread, continuously receiving messages from the server and updating the display.

7. **Tkinter Main Loop:**
   - `window.mainloop()` starts the Tkinter main loop, allowing the GUI to run and respond to user actions.

8. **Handling Disconnection:**
   - An exception handling block is included to handle disconnection gracefully.

These scripts together create a simple client-server chat application using sockets and Tkinter for the GUI. The server handles multiple clients concurrently, and the clients can send and receive messages in real-time through a graphical interface.
